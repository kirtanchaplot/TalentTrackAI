**Features**

**Easy User Experience:**
- Resume Analyzer AI makes it easy for users. You can upload your resume without any hassle. The application is designed to be user-friendly so that anyone can use its powerful resume analysis features.
- It also uses the PyPDF2 library to quickly extract text from your uploaded resume, which is the first step in doing a thorough analysis.

**Smart Text Analysis with Langchain:**
- What makes it special is how it analyzes text. It uses a smart method called the Langchain library to break long sections of text from resumes into smaller chunks, making them more meaningful.
- This clever technique improves the accuracy of the resume analysis, and it gives users practical advice on how to enhance their job prospects.

**Enhanced LLM Integration with FAISS:**
- The application uses local LLM processing for all analysis tasks, ensuring privacy and eliminating the need for API keys.
- It uses the FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) library to convert both the text chunks and query text data into numerical vectors, simplifying the analysis process and enabling the retrieval of pertinent information.

**Intelligent Chunk Selection and LLM:**
- Utilizing similarity search, Resume Analyzer AI compares the query and chunks, enabling the selection of the top 'K' most similar chunks based on their similarity scores.
- The application processes all requests using a local LLM model, ensuring complete privacy and data security.

**Robust Question-Answering Pipeline:**
- This integration establishes a robust question-answering (QA) pipeline, making use of the load_qa_chain function, which encompasses multiple components, including the language model.
- The QA chain efficiently handles lists of input documents (docs) and a list of questions (chunks), with the response variable capturing the results, such as answers to the questions derived from the content within the input documents.

**Comprehensive Resume Analysis:**
- **Summary:** Resume Analyzer AI provides a quick, comprehensive overview of resumes, emphasizing qualifications, key experience, skills, projects, and achievements. Users can swiftly grasp profiles, enhancing review efficiency and insight.
- **Strength:** Effortlessly conducting a comprehensive resume review, it analyzes qualifications, experience, and accomplishments. It subsequently highlights strengths, providing job seekers with a competitive edge.
- **Weakness:** AI conducts thorough analysis to pinpoint weaknesses and offers tailored solutions for transforming them into strengths, empowering job seekers.
- **Suggestion:** AI provides personalized job title recommendations that align closely with the user's qualifications and resume content, facilitating an optimized job search experience.

<br />

**Selenium-Powered LinkedIn Data Scraping:**
- Utilizing Selenium and a Webdriver automated test tool, this feature enables users to input job titles, automating the data scraping process from LinkedIn. The scraped data includes crucial details such as company names, job titles, locations, URLs, and comprehensive job descriptions.
- This streamlined process enables users to easily review scraped job details and apply for positions, simplifying their job search and application experience.
